# vLEI Ecosystem Governance

## Definition

The vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) is a Layer Four Ecosystem Governance Framework of the Trust over IP Foundation that establishes GLEIF's role as the governing and administering authority for verifiable Legal Entity Identifiers. It governs the full lifecycle of vLEI Credentials -- issuance, holding, and verification -- through a hierarchically organized set of controlled documents covering governance requirements, technical specifications, credential frameworks, and information trust policies. The EGF sits at the top of the Trust over IP governance stack, providing the policy foundation upon which all vLEI ecosystem operations depend.

## Key Facts

- The EGF is structured as a Primary Document supported by controlled documents including governance requirements, technical requirements (KERI infrastructure and vLEI credentials), a glossary, risk assessment, trust assurance framework, and multiple credential governance frameworks
- Controlled documents are subject to revision and change management policies specified in the EGF Primary Document, with different review processes depending on document type
- Revisions to the vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement and its appendices are reviewed and approved by GLEIF only, without public review
- The framework encompasses 24 source documents spanning governance, technical, legal, and operational domains, collectively defining all rules for ecosystem participants
- The EGF maps to Layer 4 (Ecosystem) of the Trust over IP governance stack, with Layer 3 (Credential) handled by individual credential frameworks, Layer 2 (Provider) by QVI qualification, and Layer 1 (Utility) by KERI infrastructure
- GLEIF serves simultaneously as Governing Authority (setting policy) and Administering Authority (operational management), a dual role unique in the ToIP model

## Rules & Constraints

- All participants in the vLEI Ecosystem must comply with the requirements outlined in the EGF and its controlled documents
- Changes to controlled documents follow the Agreement Change Process defined in the Primary Document
- The EGF does not cover LEI governance processes and rules managed separately by GLEIF under the Global LEI System
- Individual credential governance frameworks (for QVI, LE, OOR, and ECR credentials) must conform to the overarching EGF requirements
- The EGF is governed under Swiss law, reflecting GLEIF's incorporation as a Swiss foundation

## Examples

- **Primary Document**: The top-level document that defines the EGF's purpose, scope, principles, and controlled document hierarchy, serving as the entry point for all governance requirements
- **Credential Framework**: Each vLEI credential type (QVI, Legal Entity, OOR, ECR) has its own governance framework specifying issuance rules, identity verification requirements, and revocation procedures
- **Technical Requirements Part 1**: The controlled document specifying KERI infrastructure requirements including AID management, key rotation policies, and witness network configuration
- **Glossary**: The normative glossary defining all terms used across the EGF, ensuring consistent interpretation by all ecosystem participants

## Disambiguation

> **vLEI Ecosystem Governance** vs **Global LEI System**: The EGF governs verifiable credential infrastructure for digital identity using KERI/ACDC technology, while the Global LEI System governs the registration and maintenance of Legal Entity Identifiers (ISO 17442) for financial transaction identification. The two systems complement each other, with the vLEI extending LEI utility into the digital trust domain.
