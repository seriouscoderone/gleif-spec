# vLEI Issuer Qualification Program

## Definition

The vLEI Issuer Qualification Program is the comprehensive evaluation process required for organizations seeking to become Qualified vLEI Issuers. Administered by GLEIF, the program assesses a Candidate vLEI Issuer's financial, operational, and information technology capabilities through a structured self-assessment checklist (Appendix 3) and a qualification program manual (Appendix 2). The evaluation includes conflict of interest assessment and letters of assurance, and upon successful completion the organization receives a QVI vLEI Credential authorizing it to issue vLEI Credentials. This program covers initial qualification only; ongoing compliance is assessed through Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification.

## Key Facts

- The program is documented across two key appendices: Appendix 2 (vLEI Issuer Qualification Program Manual) provides the procedural framework, and Appendix 3 (vLEI Issuer Qualification Program Checklist) provides the structured self-assessment instrument
- The checklist evaluates capabilities across multiple domains including financial stability, operational processes, information technology infrastructure, KERI/ACDC technical readiness, key management practices, and business continuity planning
- Conflict of interest (COI) evaluation is a mandatory component, ensuring the Candidate vLEI Issuer has no conflicts that would compromise the integrity of credential issuance
- Letters of assurance must be provided to attest to the accuracy and completeness of the qualification documentation submitted
- Qualification documentation submitted by the Candidate becomes binding upon successful qualification, meaning the QVI must continue to adhere to the representations made during the evaluation
- The program must verify that the Candidate can implement GLEIF-sponsored vLEI software and operate the required KERI infrastructure (multi-sig groups, witness pools, watcher networks)
- The evaluation is performed solely by GLEIF; there are no third-party qualification bodies

## Rules & Constraints

- A Candidate vLEI Issuer cannot issue any vLEI Credentials until the qualification process is complete and the QVI vLEI Credential has been issued
- The qualification documentation becomes binding -- if the QVI subsequently fails to adhere to its representations, GLEIF may trigger Extraordinary Qualification or terminate the agreement
- The Candidate must demonstrate capability to meet all technical requirements including key-pair creation infrastructure, signature creation infrastructure, multi-sig group operations, and witness pool management
- Conflict of interest evaluation must be completed and any identified conflicts resolved before qualification can be granted
- The qualification cannot be sublicensed -- the qualified status applies only to the specific legal entity that completed the program
- Revisions to the qualification program are made by GLEIF and are not subject to public review, though changes to the broader vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement include a 30-day community review period

## Examples

- **Full qualification process**: A global digital trust services company applies as a Candidate vLEI Issuer, completes the Appendix 3 checklist demonstrating its KERI infrastructure readiness, provides letters of assurance from its board, passes the COI evaluation, and receives its QVI vLEI Credential from GLEIF
- **Technical readiness assessment**: During qualification, the Candidate demonstrates its ability to operate a multi-sig QAR group, connect to GLEIF witness and watcher networks, and implement the GLEIF-supplied vLEI software stack
- **COI evaluation**: A financial services firm undergoing qualification discloses a potential conflict arising from its parent company's involvement in LEI issuance; GLEIF evaluates and either clears or requires remediation before proceeding
