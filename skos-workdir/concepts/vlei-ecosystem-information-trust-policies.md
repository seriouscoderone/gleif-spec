# Information Trust Policies

## Definition

The Information Trust Policies are a suite of controlled documents within the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework that establish the data protection, privacy, security, developer security, incident response, and confidentiality requirements applicable to all vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders. These policies include the vLEI Data Protection Policy aligned with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP), the Stakeholder Privacy and Security Policies, the Security Incidents Policy, the Developer Security Policy, and the bilateral Non-Disclosure Agreement (Appendix 1) between GLEIF and each Qualified vLEI Issuer.

## Key Facts

- The NDA between GLEIF and each QVI remains valid indefinitely after termination of the Qualification Agreement, ensuring perpetual protection of confidential information exchanged during the qualification process
- Confidential Information must be transmitted in text form and clearly marked as CONFIDENTIAL to qualify for NDA protection; information already publicly known or disclosed by law is excluded
- The Stakeholder Security Policy requires all ecosystem participants to publish, annually review, and maintain IT security policies, including criminal background checks for personnel and designation of an Information Security Manager
- Privacy breaches involving suspected or actual unauthorized disclosure of personal data must be reported between involved stakeholders and documented in formal Incident Reports
- The Developer Security Policy requires QVI developers to follow security recommendations from both the W3C Verifiable Credentials specification and the Trust over IP ACDC specification
- Legal Entities receiving vLEI Credentials must ensure their privacy policies adequately protect persons to whom OOR and ECR credentials are issued

## Rules & Constraints

- Qualified vLEI Issuers must maintain documented incident response procedures following ITIL Incident Management guidelines
- All vLEI data protection practices must comply with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP), regardless of the QVI's home jurisdiction
- The NDA defines specific roles: the Disclosing Party furnishes confidential information, and the Receiving Party (including affiliates, employees, and advisors) must protect it; for GLEIF, the Receiving Party additionally includes the ROC Chairperson and designated Supervisor
- Security incidents involving unauthorized access to vLEI data require defined response plans and investigation procedures
- GLEIF must provide technical upgrades to vLEI software, while QVIs must implement these upgrades in accordance with the Developer Security Policy

## Examples

- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (Appendix 1)**: A bilateral confidentiality agreement executed between GLEIF and each QVI, covering all information exchanged during and after the qualification process
- **Privacy Breach Response**: When a QVI discovers unauthorized disclosure of personal data from OOR credentials, it must immediately report the incident to GLEIF and affected parties, then produce a formal Incident Report
- **Security Policy Compliance**: A QVI publishes its IT security policy annually, designates an Information Security Manager, and conducts background checks on staff with access to vLEI systems

## Disambiguation

> **Information Trust Policies** vs **Risk Assessment**: Information Trust Policies define the mandatory security, privacy, and confidentiality requirements that ecosystem participants must implement, while the Risk Assessment categorizes and evaluates potential threats and their treatments. The policies are prescriptive (what you must do), while the risk assessment is analytical (what could go wrong).
