# TrustMark

## Definition

The TrustMark is a certification mark provided by GLEIF to a Qualified vLEI Issuer upon successful completion of the vLEI Issuer Qualification Program, signifying that the QVI has met all requirements of the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework. It is subject to specific Terms of Use (Appendix 6 of the Qualification Agreement) governing how it may be displayed, the restrictions on implying broader GLEIF association, and the consequences of misuse including liquidated damages.

## Key Facts

- The TrustMark must be displayed on the QVI's website to indicate its qualified status, serving as a public signal to Legal Entities and verifiers that the QVI is authorized to issue vLEI Credentials
- The TrustMark does not convey any intellectual property rights in vLEIs to the QVI; it is a license to display, not a transfer of ownership
- The TrustMark must be removed immediately upon termination of the Qualification Agreement or failure to complete Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification
- The Terms of Use (Appendix 6) explicitly prohibit the QVI from providing the TrustMark to third parties or using it to imply a broader association with GLEIF beyond the qualified services
- Non-compliance with TrustMark terms can trigger liquidated damages provisions under the vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement
- The TrustMark functions as a visual trust anchor in the ecosystem, making qualification status immediately recognizable without requiring credential verification

## Rules & Constraints

- QVIs must display the TrustMark only on their own website and only for services within the scope of their vLEI qualification
- The TrustMark must not be used to imply GLEIF endorsement, partnership, or association beyond the QVI's qualified vLEI issuance services
- Upon loss of qualification (termination, non-renewal, or revocation), the TrustMark must be removed from all public-facing materials immediately
- The TrustMark may not be sublicensed, shared with, or made available to any third party
- Misuse of the TrustMark constitutes a breach of the Qualification Agreement and may result in liquidated damages and termination

## Examples

- **Website Display**: A Qualified vLEI Issuer places the TrustMark on its homepage and vLEI services page, signaling to prospective Legal Entity clients that it is authorized by GLEIF to issue vLEI Credentials
- **Removal After Non-Renewal**: A QVI fails to complete its Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification by the anniversary date; it must immediately remove the TrustMark from its website and cease representing itself as qualified
- **Improper Use**: A QVI places the TrustMark on marketing materials for non-vLEI services, implying GLEIF endorsement of unrelated products, triggering a compliance investigation and potential liquidated damages

## Disambiguation

> **TrustMark** vs **QVI vLEI Credential**: The TrustMark is a visual certification mark for public display on the QVI's website, while the QVI vLEI Credential is a cryptographic ACDC credential issued by GLEIF that programmatically authorizes the QVI to issue downstream credentials. The TrustMark communicates trust to humans; the credential communicates trust to software.
