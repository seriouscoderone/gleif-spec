# Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification

## Definition

Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification is the recurring evaluation process performed by GLEIF to ensure that a Qualified vLEI Issuer continues to meet the requirements of the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework. It is conducted on or after the anniversary date of the QVI's initial qualification. This concept also encompasses Extraordinary vLEI Issuer Qualification, which is triggered under exceptional circumstances when GLEIF has reason to believe that a QVI's qualification documentation is no longer current or being adhered to. Additionally, GLEIF retains broad verification and audit rights over QVI internal controls and operations.

## Key Facts

- Annual qualification is conducted on each anniversary date of the initial qualification, creating a predictable recurring evaluation cycle
- Extraordinary qualification can be triggered at any time, outside the annual cycle, when GLEIF has reason to believe a QVI's documentation is no longer current or being adhered to
- GLEIF has the right to conduct verifications and audits of a QVI's internal controls, operations, and records to ensure ongoing compliance
- Failure to complete annual qualification requires the QVI to remove the GLEIF TrustMark from its website and may lead to credential revocation
- The annual process evaluates continued compliance across the same domains as initial qualification: financial stability, operational processes, IT infrastructure, and KERI technical readiness
- QVI Records must be retained for at least 10 years and made available to GLEIF during verification and audit activities
- The annual qualification feeds into the Trust Assurance Framework's Conformance Assurance dimension, providing the formal evaluation mechanism for ongoing compliance

## Rules & Constraints

- Annual qualification must be completed on or after the anniversary date; it cannot be deferred without consequence
- If a QVI fails annual qualification, GLEIF may revoke the QVI vLEI Credential, triggering a cascade that invalidates all downstream Legal Entity, OOR, and ECR credentials issued by that QVI
- GLEIF may conduct Extraordinary Qualification at any time without waiting for the anniversary date
- Audit reports and verification findings must be documented and retained by both GLEIF and the QVI
- The QVI must cooperate fully with GLEIF's verification and audit requests, including providing access to internal records and procedures
- Changes in the QVI's operational capabilities, financial status, or key personnel between annual cycles may trigger Extraordinary Qualification

## Examples

- **Routine annual review**: A QVI that completed initial qualification on March 15, 2024 undergoes its first annual qualification evaluation on or after March 15, 2025, demonstrating continued compliance with all EGF requirements
- **Extraordinary qualification trigger**: GLEIF receives a report that a QVI has experienced a significant cybersecurity incident affecting its key management infrastructure, prompting an Extraordinary Qualification evaluation outside the normal annual cycle
- **Audit of QVI internal controls**: GLEIF exercises its verification and audit rights to inspect a QVI's private key storage practices, witness pool configuration, and incident response procedures, documenting findings in an audit report
- **Failure consequence**: A QVI that cannot demonstrate compliance during annual qualification has its QVI vLEI Credential revoked, requiring it to remove the TrustMark and triggering a grace period for downstream credential holders to transition to a new QVI

## Disambiguation

> **Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification** vs **vLEI Issuer Qualification Program**: The vLEI Issuer Qualification Program is the initial evaluation for Candidate vLEI Issuers seeking to become qualified. Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification is the recurring evaluation for already-qualified QVIs to maintain their status. The initial program qualifies; the annual process re-validates.
